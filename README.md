This is a bot for converting x- or z-sampa to IPA, or converting a custom ascii notation to standard PIE notation. Simply type your ascii inside // or [] with a prefixed x, z or p for x-sampa, z-sampa and PIE-notation respectively.
For instance,
x[sts_>q_hts_ht_hx] gives [st͡sʼqʰt͡sʰtʰx]
x/dZAn "m{d@n/ gives /d͡ʒɑn ˈmædən/
p[x2"owis x1"ek'wo:s-kve] gives *h₂ówis h₁é"kwōs-kʷe

For the PIE notation, a preceding " is acute accent, a following : is the macron, a following . is the syllabicity marker, h always becomes superscript and v is superscript w. Palato-velars are marked with a following ' and x1, x2, x3 etc. yields the laryngeals, with x@ for the subscript a laryngeal, and xx for an unknown laryngeal. This is best learned by experimenting.
